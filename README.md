# myFirstDictionary
Here is my first SWIFT project, which is consists on simple code right now, but the more ill know, the bigger and powerful it will be.
This part of code provides creating and adding new English words and their Russian translations in corresponding arryas. This array, finally, I unite in one dictionary, where English word is the key and Russian word is it's description. 
In future I'm gonna add much more new strings of code and spread it's functional. 
One day it will be done. Small step for others. The biggest step for me.
